            <p>The human body cannot absorb much chlorophyll, but chlorophyll binds to these carcinogens and prevents
                the body from absorbing them. In this way, kale may limit the risk of cancer, and pairing a chargrilled
                steak with green vegetables may help reduce the negative impact.</p>

            fromthe vinegar, the cucumbers and onion are so pleasantly crunchy you can’t stop eating them, and
            thetomatoes are so juicy and sweet they burst in your mouth. It’s perfect as a light summer snack, but would
